function [hdr,vol] = niak_read_nifti(file_name)
% Read a NIFTI file (.NII or .IMG).
% The old Analyze 7.5 is also supported, and if a .MAT file is present, the
% affine transformation information will be included.

%
% SYNTAX: [HDR,VOL] = NIAK_READ_NIFTI(FILE_NAME)
%
% FILE_NAME (string) a 3D+t or 3D minc nifti file.
% VOL (3D+t or 3D array of double) the fMRI or MRI data.
% HDR (structure) a description of the data. See NIAK_READ_VOL 
%    and NIAK_READ_HDR_NIFTI for details.
%
% SEE ALSO: NIAK_READ_HDR_NIFTI, NIAK_WRITE_NIFTI, NIAK_READ_VOL, 
%     NIAK_WRITE_VOL, NIAK_READ_DATA_NIFI
%
% COMMENTS:
%   In case of multiple files data (e.g. .IMG + .HDR, or .IMG + .HDR + .MAT),
%   specify the name using the .IMG extension only.
%
%   The affine transformation in hdr.info corresponds to the sform, if specified, or 
%   the qform (if sform unspecified and qform is), or simply the pixel dimension 
%   and offset, if neither qform or sform are specified. 
% 
%   The data is forced to single precision.
