The neuroimaging analysis kit (NIAK) is a library of functions for the preprocessing and mining of large functional neuroimaging data, using GNU Octave or Matlab(r), and distributed under a MIT license. Essential documentation can be found on the [NIAK website](http://niak.simexp-lab.org/). The NIAK is developed and maintained by members and collaborators of the [SIMEXP laboratory](simexp-lab.org), Department of Computer Science and Operations research ([DIRO](http://en.diro.umontreal.ca/home/)), Geriatric institute of Montreal ([CRIUGM](http://www.criugm.qc.ca/)), [University of Montreal](http://www.umontreal.ca/english/). Many of the functions of the kit are based on software developed over the years by members and collaborators of the [Brain Imaging Center](http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/), [McGill University](http://www.mcgill.ca/). See the [contributors](https://github.com/SIMEXP/niak/wiki/NIAK-contributors) page for more details.
