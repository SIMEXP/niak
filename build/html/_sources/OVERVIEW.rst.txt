NIAK overview
=============

The neuroimaging analysis kit (NIAK) is a library of pipelines for the preprocessing and mining of connectomes extracted from large functional magnetic resonance imaging data, using GNU `Octave <http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/>`_. NIAK offers a catalogue of robust, validated workflows for complex tasks such as registration and denoising of brain images, as well as data-driven functional brain parcellation or connectome-wide association studies. NIAK is an open-source software distributed under `MIT license <http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_. Linux, Mac OSX and Windows are supported using `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ or `Singularity <http://singularity.lbl.gov/>`_. The package reads and writes MINC or NIFTI 4D files (possibly compressed). A list of all contributors can be found on the `github wiki <https://github.com/SIMEXP/niak/wiki/NIAK-contributors>`_.

.. note:: ``NIAK`` has lived a long and happy life, but has now become redundant with other more active projects, namely `fMRIprep <https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html>`_ and `nilearn <https://nilearn.github.io/>`_. NIAK's end of life is scheduled for the end of 2020. Expect only critical bug fixes and minimal support until then. You can still leave an `issue <https://github.com/SIMEXP/niak/issues>`_ or head to the `forum <https://www.nitrc.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=1821>`_.
