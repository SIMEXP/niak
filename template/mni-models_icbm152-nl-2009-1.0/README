MNI ICBM152 non-linear 40th generation symmetric and asymmetric Average Brain
                     Stereotaxic Registration Model
                                  2009

This is a very partial version of the ICBM Average Brain - an average of 152
T1-weighted MRI scans, linearly and non-linearly (40 iterations)
transformed to form symmetric and asymmetric models in Talairach 
space - that is specially adapted for use with the MNI Linear 
Registration Package (mni_autoreg). 
Please see http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesAtlases/HomePage for the full version of the package.

Please note that the volumes here are different from the mni305 model
(average_305) that was originally (back in ancient times) included
with mni_autoreg.

Included in this package are the following files:

  mni_icbm152_{t1,t2,pd,gm,wm,csf,cls}_tal_nlin_{asym,sym}_09a[_{mask,headmask,eye_mask,face_mask,outline}].mnc

where 

  t1 - T1w modality [0,100]
  t2 - T2w modality [0,100]
  pd - PDw modality [0,100]
  gm - GM probability map [0,1]
  wm - WM probability map [0,1]
  csf - CSF probability map [0,1]
  cls - hard classes ( 1 - CSF, 2 - GM, 3 - WM )

  asym - asymmetric version of the model
  sym - symmetric version of the model

  mask - brain mask, it is the same for all modalities but only file for 
         T1w exists [0;1]
  headmask - head mask including skull, it is the same for all modalities 
             but only file for T1w exists [0;1]
  eye_mask - mask for the eyes, it is the same for all modalities 
             but only file for T1w exists [0;1]
  face_mask - mask for face stripping, it is the same for all 
              modalities but only file for T1w exists [0;1]
  outline - approximate brain surface outline (useful for QC scripts, for 
            quick checking of the quality of linear registration) [0;1]

All volumes are sampled with 1mm cubic voxels.
